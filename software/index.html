                <h1>Leonis Toolkit</h1>
                <img src="project_0.png" />
                <p>
                    Leonis is a collection of custom made programs and Godot
                    add-ons designed to provide an efficient workflow and
                    future-proof my game development pipelines. Each tool is
                    created to either improve Godot's current capabilities or
                    introduce new systems that will effectively shorten the time
                    spent on developing games.
                    <br />
                    <br />To allow for a more modular structure for each game,
                    each tool builds on the game engine via add-ons that
                    function independently.
                    <br />
                    <br />The toolkit focuses on improving workflows for 3D
                    games and there are no plans for any 2D focused tools.
                    <br>Some of the tools included are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>AI Manager</b>: A system for managing AI logic and behaviour trees.</li>
                        <li><b>Debugging Tools</b> A simple tool for debugging games at runtime and extends Godot's existing debugger.</li>
                        <li><b>RPG Kit</b> A tool for managing content for RPG or similar games.</li>
                        <li><b>Terraform</b> A terrain editor for Godot as well as a standalone terrain generator.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The entire project is still in the early stages of development but you can find the source code for all the tools <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LEOTHERA-DEV/leonis-toolkit">here</a>.

                    TerraOS is a project that aims to take a unique spin on OS development.
                <br>Made using Assembly and C. This Operating system hosts a persistant simulated world that continues to evolve even when the host is turned off.
                <br>More information soon.
