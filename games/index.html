                    <br />
                    <br />Designed as an indirect sequel to
                    <b>Project: Axolus</b>. <b>AXOLOTL 40</b> focuses on Earth's
                    industrial giants as they put their new Mechs to the test in
                    an interplanetary battle against alien races.

                <img src="project_1.png" />
                <p>
                    A series of retro styled action role-playing games featuring
                    gameplay mechanics inspired by older RPGs and MMOs.
                    <br />The first game, simply named <b>Project: Axolus</b>,
                    is set in an alternate solar system in which Saturn's
                    remaining inhabitants begin a long term mission of
                    retrieving lost relics across the galaxy. <br />A free demo
                    will be available on itch.io soon.

                <h1>Project: Edith</h1>
                <img src="project_3.png" />
                <p>
                    <b>Edith</b> (Working Title) is an first person narrative
                    driven game with a darker tone and plot. The game aims to 
		    explore various conditions such as anxiety, depression and
		    gender dysphoria by being set in a world where the protagonist
		    has to live a life in a world that never remains constant and
		    is difficult to keep up with.
		    <br>Unlike the other games I'm working on, this one combines 
		    visual novel elements with an interactable world, giving you 
		    complete freedom to explore various areas without being constrained 
		    by the main story.
		    <br>
		    <br><b>Edith</b> currently does not have a release date.

                    events caused by beings from an unknown realm.
